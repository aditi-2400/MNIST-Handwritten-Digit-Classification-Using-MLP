# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Using-MLP
This project using Multilayer Perceptron neural network to classify handwritten digits

Model Architecture

The MLP model consists of the following layers:

Input Layer: 784 neurons (28x28 pixels flattened).
Hidden Layer(s): One or more hidden layers with ReLU activation.
Output Layer: 10 neurons (one for each digit) with softmax activation.
